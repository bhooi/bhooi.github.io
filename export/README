============ RUNNING STREAMCAST ON A TEST EXAMPLE ============

The simplest way to run StreamCast is to run main.m in Matlab.
(Make sure Matlab has its current directory set to the code directory of this package)

This runs the StreamCast forecasting algorithm (etsbig_forecast) on either the CMU or LBNL dataset.

The main function allows for toggling between the CMU and LBNL datasets by switching the 'dataset' variable to either 'CMU' or 'LBNL' accordingly.

Note that the CMU dataset has hourly samples, so the period is 24, while the LBNL dataset has samples every 5 minutes, so the period is 288. 

============ FUNCTIONS IN STREAMCAST ============

The main function for use in StreamCast is etsbig_forecast. Its inputs are:

Ir, Ii: input real and imaginary current time series
Vr, Vi: input real and imaginary voltage time series
temp: input temperature time series
m: period (e.g. 24 for CMU dataset and 288 for LBNL dataset)
pred_len: number of time steps to forecast
alpha, beta, gamma: learning rate hyperparameters
phi: damping factor (typically 1)
lambda, lambda2: seasonal and overall regularization (typically 0)
tempcoef: initialization point for temperature vector (typically [0 0 0 0 0])
whatif_mod: used only for whatif experiments; typically set to []

Its outputs are:

Vr_fc, Vi_fc, Ir_fc, Ii_fc: forecasted voltage and current values
Irhat, Iihat: fitted current values
